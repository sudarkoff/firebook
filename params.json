Well, if you ever tried lighting a fire on a rainy day, you might know that a simple task of taking a match to a bundle of kindling does not suffice. The task borders on the impossible. And what if you don't have any matches or a lighter with you? Knowing a couple of tricks could turn a cold dark night in the woods into a memorable and fun adventure or even save your ass.\r\n\r\nFinally, fire is a fascinating subject in its own right. I had fun learning about it while doing my research for this book and I hope you'll enjoy it too.\r\n\r\n## Generating Ebooks\r\n\r\n    $ ./makeebooks en\r\n\r\n## Errata\r\n\r\nIf you spot any technical or other mistakes, please email me at\r\ngeorge@sudarkoff.com.","name":"Firebook","tagline":"Fire Book: history, theory and practice of starting a fire in any situation and with virtually any implement (or no implements at all)."}
