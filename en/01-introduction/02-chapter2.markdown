## What is fire?

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, fire is a "rapid burning of combustible material with the evolution of heat and usually accompanied by flame." If it sounds a bit recursive to you, it's because it is. Wikipedia does a slightly better job: "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products. Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition."





This chemical process requires three elements to go on: a combustible material - fuel, an oxidizer - air, and heat.
