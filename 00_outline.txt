Fire
The theory and practice of starting a fire in a survival situation.

    1. Theory of fire
    2. Preparation
      - location, clean the debris, shield from elements (rain, wind), etc.
      - collect tinder, kindling, fuel
    3. Fuel
      - Wood, dry grass, turf, etc.
      - Petroleum-based products (gasoline, machine oil, etc.)
      - Animal fat or it's byproducts
      - Chemicals
      - ...
    4. Types of fire
      - cooking, heating, signaling, etc.
      - different configurations of fire (also talk about reflectors and such)
    5. Starting a fire
      a. Friction
        - Fire bow or bow drill
        - Whatever is Hawaiian method called (fire plow?)
        - Indian method of spinning the drill with hands
        - Fire Saw
      b. Percussion
      c. Solar (concentrated sun light)
        - A lens.
        - Water balloon (or a condom).

      d. Electricity
        - battery (http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/how-to-make-a-fire-with-batteries-and-steel-wool/)
      e. Chemical reaction
        - Ex.: Potassium permanganate + glycerin (part of antifreeze)
          http://www.primitiveways.com/chemical_fire.html
        - Sodium from the engine valve and water
    6. Fire safety
        - how to prevent wildfires
        - how to prevent injuries
        - how to treat burns

Ideas:
 - YouTube and Flickr channels for pictures and videos of readers starting a fire with one of the methods.
 - Ask people about their favorite methods of finding and prepare tinder.
 - Insert real-life stories about fire here and there (ask for submissions).
