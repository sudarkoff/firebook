=Fire

The theory and practice of starting a fire in a survival situation.

==Theory of fire

Fire is a chemical reaction. It involves three components: (1) heat; (2) oxidizer and (3) fuel. You need all three of these components to start and sustain a fire. Most common oxidizer is the oxygen (as the name suggests) in the air. Most common fuel is the wood. Most common means of producing heat is friction.

==Preparation

Most preparation is spent on finding a good location for a fire, removing the debris and possibly shielding the location from elements (rain, wind) and finally collecting and preparing fuel. Fuel typically consists of three parts: you need tinder for easy fire starting, kindling to build up the fire and fuel to keep the fire going and producing a necessary amount of heat. All of these preparation steps are essential. It would be pretty horrible if you managed to light up the tinder after an hour of hard labor only to discover that you don't have enough kindling to build the fire up and keep it going. Or have it put out by a burst of wind.

==Fuel

There are many materials you can burn in order to produce heat.
Wood, dry grass, turf, etc.
Petroleum-based products (gasoline, machine oil, etc.)
Animal fat or it's byproducts
Chemicals
...

==Types of fire

Cooking, heating, signaling, etc. Then there are different configurations of fire. Also talk about reflectors and such.

==Starting a fire

 - Friction
 - Percussion
 - Solar
 - Electricity
 - Chemical reaction
   Ex.: Potassium permanganate + glycerin (part of antifreeze)

===Friction

 - Fire bow or bow drill
 - Whatever is Hawaiian method called (fire plow?)
 - Indian method of spinning the drill with hands
 - Fire Saw

===Percussion

===Concentrated sun light

 - A lens.
 - Water balloon (or a condom).
 - Piece of ice.
 - Polished piece of metal of parabolic shape (soda can)

In other words, types of lenses or parabolic mirrors, how does it get light rays to meet at the point, etc.

===Electricity

 - Battery

===Chemical reaction

natrium from the engine valve and water

==Fire safety

If you remember just one thing, remember to never leave the fire unattended.

==Ideas

 - YouTube and Flickr channels for pictures and videos of readers starting a fire with one of the methods.
 - Ask people about their favorite methods of finding and prepare tinder.
 - Insert real-life stories about fire here and there (ask for submissions).
