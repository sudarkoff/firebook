# FIRE
*The theory and practice of fire.*

What's the scope of the book? Do I talk about outdoors only? How about fire safety in an urban situation?

  1. Theory and history of fire
  2. Preparation
    - location, clean the debris, shield from elements (rain, wind), etc.
    - collect tinder, kindling, fuel
  3. Starting a fire (friction, percussion, solar, electricity, chemical reaction)
  4. Troubleshooting (including feeding the fire)
  5. Types of fire
    - cooking, heating, signaling, etc.
    - different configurations of fire (also talk about reflectors and such)
  6. Fire safety (preventing wildfires and accidents and treating burns)

## Ideas

 - YouTube and Flickr channels for pictures and videos of readers starting a fire with one of the methods.
 - Ask people about their favorite methods of finding and prepare tinder.
 - Insert real-life stories about fire here and there (ask for submissions).

## Random bits

 - Who invented matches? Who invented a lighter?
 - when did humans master fire (based on our digestive system and our evidence)
 - What is fire
 - fire in art (from cave paintings to renaissance to modern art, movies, songs, etc.)
 - Fire in the rain
     # Light a Fire in the Rain
     If you're not one of those people carrying a dry tinder and a lighter on your person at all times, you will need to improvise if you need to light a fire in the rain.

     Air
      - Shelter your fire from the rain and the wind

     Tinder
      - Cotton ball soaked in ChapStick
      - Purell gel
      - Resin

     Spark/Heat
      - Firesteel
      - Car cigarette lighter

     Other methods
      - Steel wool + battery
      - Sodium in metal extracted form the valve of an engine
     
 - History of fire (fire and homo sapiens)
     Fire is the first energy source humans harnessed. And one way or another, fire still keeps us warm or cool, nourished and moving forward.
