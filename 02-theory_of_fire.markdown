# History and theory of fire

## What is fire?

According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, fire is a "rapid burning of combustible material with the evolution of heat and usually accompanied by flame." If it sounds a bit recursive to you, that is because it is - fire is a combustion accompanied by flame, hm? Wikipedia does a slightly better job, but it still leaves you wondering: "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products."

So just what is fire?

It is a chemical process indeed, it does involve rapid oxidation of a combustible material, and it is usually accompanied by the release of heat and light. But let's leave the technical details alone for a while.

Fire has been one of the main driving forces of the human progress. There was of course the time, we'll have to conclude logically, when man knew no fire...
