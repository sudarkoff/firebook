# Theory of fire

## What is fire?

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, fire is a "rapid burning of combustible material with the evolution of heat and usually accompanied by flame." If it sounds a bit recursive to you, that is because it is. Wikipedia does a slightly better job, but it still leaves you wondering: "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products."

So what is fire?

This chemical process requires three elements to go on: a combustible material - fuel, an oxidizer - air, and heat.
